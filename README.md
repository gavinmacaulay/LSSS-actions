# LSSS actions
 
This repository contains LSSS Actions - these provide additional LSSS functionality via the API provided by LSSS.

Many of these Actions contain hard-coded directory paths and many are intended for specific processing steps. However, they provide examples of the sort of things that can be achieved using the API and will become more general with time.

A package can be installed in LSSS using these steps:
- Clone the repository
- Create a zip file of the files inside the Utilities directory
- In LSSS, choose the 'Import package from zip file' button from the Configuration/Application configuration/Miscellaneous/Packages config dialog and select the zip file that you made:
